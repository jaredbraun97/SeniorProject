Website development for freedom teams

Scenario:

Freedom teams recently received a generous donation from an anonymous
donor earmarked for the purpose of developing a new website, which I
volunteered to develop for 50\$ hr, alternatively I could work for free
but for the purpose of this project I have to monitor my expenses and
labor is included in that. They wanted a better designed and more
reliable website. I suggested hosting the website through Amazon to save
money by not going through a hosting company like Wix which is what they
currently use. Freedom teams wanted at least a portion of the web page
to be editable so that they could update the users on their prayer
requests.

The website is needed to first save money, even though it\'s a small
amount per month for a faith based organization the ease of the monthly
burden to just a few dollars is helpful. Second, a better designed
website will hopefully draw more users or get current users to spend
more time on the website which could help further the mission of freedom
teams. Third is that they deserve a better website. As christians we
should help our brothers especially when their need corresponds with our
area of expertise.
