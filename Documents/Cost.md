Cost 
	Labor cost at $50 an hour. 
	Total hours spent = 251
	Total labor cost= $12,550
 	Cost of equipment 
	Ubuntu vm: $500 I think I remember that $500 is the price of any vms configured
Amazon webserver- ranges from $0 to $30 a month. Lets say $20 so we get a high estimate so over the year its $300. Which is too high
Alternatively a low end server can be lower than $300. But there would probably be a higher cost to the internet bill. Unfortunately I couldn’t find that as most companies aren’t upfront with their prices. So the user should get a quote before deciding 
One user but several services PHP and apache, ssh, and mysql (I’ll call it $500 because they might be called servers they are actually just services)
$11 a year for domain( never configured)
Cost total = $13,811
The cost of their current website is about $15 a month so $180 annually, I estimate very high for the amazon solution though and they have paid tiers that I imagine have higher data for less money. 
The website got upgraded between my initial submission and now so the upgrade of the website feels less substantial, and with the higher than expected cost of aws even annually the savings aren’t there. 
Going up against the premade sights like wix and square space is really hard to beat there value because of the economy of scale, and even there templates are high enough quality that a new web developer even with a lot knowledge would have a hard time competing with. Especially with the hourly rate I had to charge for this project. 
	So ultimately I would argue against the custom sight unless it was being done for free.  But if it is free or paid for by some generous donor I think that this solution is better even with aws’s potentially higher price. AWS Is far more reliable than wix and its ilk.
